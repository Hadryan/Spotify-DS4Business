## TrackTracer: Analyzing Audio Features for Social Media Track Popularity Estimation
Importance of BGM: The report emphasizes the significance of BGM in short video ads, with a 16% increase in impressions compared to ads without music.
Aligning with Music Trends: Advertising content that aligns with current music trends is more likely to be watched in its entirety and shared by a wider audience.
We introduce a predictive model designed to identify potential hit songs for short video advertising. This model could offer valuable insights for advertisers seeking to stay ahead of music trends and align their content accordingly.


### Recommended Strategy

The report proposes a strategy for TikTok, suggesting the curation of a list of songs anticipated to become popular. This curated list can simplify content creation for TikTok and its creators, leading to increased user engagement and potential ad revenue growth. To validate the model's effectiveness, we tested it on a list of new songs added to Spotify, resulting in the identification of the top three songs:
SAY MY GRACE by Offset ft. Travis Scott, 
Hope You Know by Kodak Black, 
My Simple Jeep by Eyedress (feat. Mac DeMarco).

By allocating resources to develop templates and proactively promoting these songs to advertisers, TikTok can position itself as a frontrunner in capitalizing on music trends. This repository includes our models and data collection efforts, which have been instrumental in shaping this strategic approach for TikTok's growth and profitability.

### Conclusion

This approach could result in cost savings through favorable licensing deals, and it positions TikTok as a frontrunner in staying ahead of music trends. The report concludes with the top three songs identified through the model, encouraging TikTok to allocate resources for the development of templates and promote these songs to maintain a competitive edge in the short video advertising landscape.
